"""Thin adapter between the risk-gated order flow and Alpaca's trading
API, via alpaca-py.

Switched from an earlier IBKR-based design (see git history / project
README) once it became clear this session already had working Alpaca
paper-trading credentials from an unrelated prior project (NewsTrader),
with no new account setup needed -- IBKR would have required installing
TWS/Gateway and opening a new account first.

Strategy code should never call alpaca-py directly -- it should only
ever go through GatedOrderRouter, so every order passes the RiskGate
first.
